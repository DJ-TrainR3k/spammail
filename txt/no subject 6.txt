My Beloved.

I am sorry to encroach into your privacy in this manner; I found your
email listed in the Chambers of Commerce directory while searching for
trustworthy person. I know it will be a great surprise reading from me
today but consider this a divine intervention. My name is Mrs.
Stephanie Smith, a widow from Switzerland. I am presently writing you
from my sickbed because i have been fighting cancer and the doctor says
i have a few weeks left.

I want to entrust my money $73 million dollars to your care for charity
purposes and crave your indulgence as a concerned individual to help
use my money for charity and also assist the poor with less privileged
in the society so reply to my email for more information as I'm not
always online due to my health and my late husband's brother wants me
dead so that he will claim all my late husband and i worked for.

I will tell you more about myself and what you need to do with the
money once your receive it. Give me your word that you will not betray
my trust so that i furnish you with more details about the Charity
Funds. Please reply now as my health is pretty bad, itâ€™s urgent and
very important you keep this email confidential by sending your respond
to my private email: ( stepsmit7@att.net ) to have privacy with you and
discuss on this opportunity.

Have a blessed day and do not forget to pray for me.

Bless you.
Mrs. Stephanie Smith.
