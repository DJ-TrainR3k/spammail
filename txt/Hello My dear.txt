Hello My dear!

With great respect, i am writing to you this mail.My name is Noni Oluwa, 23 years of age, i am the only daughter of Late David Oluwa from Liberia, my father was the owner of David Cocoa Industries Limited and he was a personal adviser to our former Head of State (late General Ben Keny). My purpose of contacting you is first, i want to know more about you so that i will know the areas you will be of assistance to my needs. I have some reasonable amount of moneys which my parents left for me before their untimely death, i want to plan for my future by investing this money in a good and profitable business but I donâ€™t know where to start and that is why I got interested in contacting you hoping that you will be kind a sincere to me by leading me through the right process to see that this money is not wasted because it is my only hope of planning for my future .

From your contact i observed you are an important personality before i made up my mind to contact you.Though i don't know you in person but your assurance can motivate me to tell you everything about the money i want to invest and to go into this investment with by my side . i have no experience i terms of any foreign investment but I wish you could be honest to me because i am afraid of choosing the wrong business or loose this money . As soon as i receive your respond we will decide on the next line of action, remember you caught my attention when I saw your contact and that was why i have the courage to write you in the first place. You will know me more as we communicate along and I will also send my pictures as soon as i hear from you so that you will see who you are communicating with.

Hoping to hear from you soon.
Yours sincerely


Noni
