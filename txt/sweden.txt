Hello.

I hope this letter finds you in the best of health and spirit. Forgive my intrusion as I know that this is an unconventional way of reaching out to you.

My name is Amelia Lola and I'm Sweden. My reason for writing you is to seek your friendship! Just being adventurous and decided to use this letter as a resource tool to get your attention. As a matter of fact, I've been wanting to try this a while now to chat. But I've been clueless on how to go about it.

Maybe you find it strange that I'm using something as cold as this means to reach you. But this is the best I can do for now.In short: the purpose of this letter is just to ask you if you want to be my friend. And if you agree, just say yes and we can take it on from there.

I look forward to hear hearing from you.




Lola.
