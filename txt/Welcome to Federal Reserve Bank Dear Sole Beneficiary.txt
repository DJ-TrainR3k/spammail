Your payment files from three (3) different banks, NatWest Bank of
London, Central Bank of Nigeria, Benin Republic and Federal Reserve
Bank was compiled and submitted to my desk this month for review. The
total sum owed to you by the 3 banks mentioned above was sum up to the
tune of US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars).

Now the fund has been totally lodged in one particular Escrow account
(non deductible) here in the Federal Reserve Bank on your name, while
waiting for accreditation to your personal bank account in any part of
the world.

Meanwhile, after due scrutiny and verification, I confirmed that you
have fulfilled all the necessary obligations that will enable the
release of your payment to you, but yet your payment was not released
to you due to one flimsy excuses or the other from the Bank officials
in charge of your payment, because they had the intention of diverting
your funds to their private accounts in order to satisfy their
interest.

Bank detected their plans and therefore call for the submission of

assignment to ensure that you receive your funds accordingly.
