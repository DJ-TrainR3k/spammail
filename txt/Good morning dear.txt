Good morning dear,

I am  Kim Hope personal Account officer to a deceased customer of our bank
here in Cambodia from your country , due to my position I will need your
co-operative assistance to move a certain fortune/funds of a deceased
client who died on 14 of November 2011.

The Board of Directors of the bank resolved to turn the estate of the
deceased over to Government pause having waited for too long without any
of the deceased relatives/next of kin surfacing, and if this is done, the
funds will end up to become Government property in-which the so called top
political empire's will embezzle it, while we that labored in the office
earn nothing.

I want to present you as the beneficiary of the deceased. I will use my
position and influence in our bank to make sure they release this money to
you for our mutual sharing. If I wait for days and did not hear from you,
I shall look for another person.

Sincerely

Kim Hope
