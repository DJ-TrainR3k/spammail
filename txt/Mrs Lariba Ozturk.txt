Dear friend,
I write this letter with heart full of sincerity and tension. My name
is Mrs  Lariba  Azima Ozturk, wife of  General  Akin Ozturk, former
four-star General in the Turkish Air Force who served as the 30th
Commander of the Turkish Air Force until August 4, 2015,After his
expiration as commander, he continued his duty as a member of the
Supreme Military Council.

My husband was arrested on 16 July 2016 on charges of having played a
leading role in the failed 2016 Turkish coup d'?tat attempt of 15
July. He was stripped of all his military ranks and indicted for
offenses against public order, terrorism, conspiracy and treason. my
husband had earlier denied the allegation with proof and evidence that
he never participated in the failed coup. Our house has been
surrendered by armed police officers and state police. I am from
Republic of Ghana  , I met my husband during united Nations peace
keeping movement in west Africa, When my husband noticed unrest with
Turkish Government, all his life savings was withdrawn from the bank,
including some Gold and diamond substance. My husband kept them in
security company in my Country Accra Ghana with the help of Ghanaian
embassy here in Istanbul Turkey. My husband has been humiliated by the
Government and has been in detention without proper medication and
food. I am under house arrest including all t he entire family of Gene
