For your honest attention,  
I am the Director of the Debt Management Office in the FMF (Federal Ministry of Finance) I hope this message finds you in good health.
Do you want to receive your payment this time?
I am in direct position to tell you the truth and what I can do to enable you receive this payment successfully now. 
There is an immediate official arrangement by my government for two (2) Contractors from your country, whose payments has been  approved to be delivered directly by Diplomatic payment system into your country, the two Contractors from your countrys fund will be delivered by Diplomats directly into your country.
If you will agree and accept my condition I will use my official Capacity and contact to fix your name among the two Contractors, then you will make them three and the fund will be delivered  together, this way there will be no much procedure, it will be easier and immediate for you.
You are free to ask me any question for more clarification.
Let me hear from you.
