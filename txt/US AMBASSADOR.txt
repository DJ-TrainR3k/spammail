Greetings from the U.S Embassy.

Sequel to previous mail sent to you via post, which returned as Undelivered by Secretary Of United Nation, I write again via email to informed you that your fund offered to you from the United Nation was brought to my desk this today because the Secretary Of United Nation here in Nigeria said that they will divert your compensation fund to the Government Treasury account just because they did not hear from you.
 
But I told them to wait until I hear from you so that I will know the reason why your funds sum of ( USD$ 2 million Dollars ) which is a compensation from United Nation. If you are still interested in this fund offered from the United Nation then I would advice you to get back to me immediately for further details.

Your urgent response is needed as soon as possible.
 
 
YOUR FULL NAME_______________
YOUR HOME ADDRESS_______
YOUR STATE AND COUNTRY___________

I will be waiting to hear from you soon.
 
Regards.
