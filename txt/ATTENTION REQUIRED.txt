Dear beneficiary,

This is Gen. John F. Kelly, the new secretary of U.S. Department of Homeland
security, appointed by President Donald Trump. Your delayed payment in the tone
of US$4,500,000.00 (Four Million, five hundred thousand United States Dollar)
that was held by IMF/FBI has been released because this is a new
administration. Following the new administration debt settlement policy, we
tendered your fund release file for immediate release and shipment to your
designated address. In this case, you are expected to reconfirm your Full Name
(as stated on your government issued photo ID), shipping address, Nearest
Airport and your Direct Cell Phone number, for immediate delivery of the
consignment box containing your total fund. These details are needed for proper
verification due to fraudulent activities going on around the globe.

I can be reached directly at  (202) 871-2969

I look forward to hearing from you.

Gen. John F. Kelly
Secretary of
The U.S. Department of
Homeland Security
Washington DC
