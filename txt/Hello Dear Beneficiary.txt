Hello Dear Beneficiary

This may come as a surprise to you, but it is good news for you, your name was
approved among the foreigners that their fund payment was delayed by the last
government.

The new president gave my office the control to pay and refund everybody that
his or her transfer is pending here in Africa, I found out from my file that
this bad corrupt bank officers has purposely delayed your payment so that they
can claim it to their selfish pockets, but thanks to or new humble upright
president who has found pity on your payment. Now 10 million dollars has been
approved to be paid to you by ATM-CARD mode, this method is simple and fast,
the 10 million dollars will be uploaded into the ATM-CARD and it will be sent
to you by courier service, you will receive the ATM-CARD in 3-4 days in your
address, and every moment you will be able to withdraw 15,000 dollars per
moment transaction, that is how it is programmed.

i will give you more details once I read from you, we need you to furnish us
with your following

1-Your address:
2-Your full names
3-Your mobile cell phone:

I will update you on how possible you will receive this payment at once in 3-4
days. All I need is your support and cooperation for a quick payment. Reply me
