Dear Friend,


                                                                             AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY.

I hope this email finds you in good health. I m Dr. Donald Adams, originally from Fiji Islands, but I am presently in Afghanistan as an expert doctor of medicine.

On the 12th of April 2014 my wife and I were approached by a British Soldier, Warrant Officer Faulkner Spencer, who handed a box full of cash totaling US$8.2 Million to me and my wife for safe keeping and begged us never to disclose this to anyone.

Unfortunately,exactly two weeks later news reached us that he had an accident and died in an Helicopter crash in Takhta Pul District, Afghanistan.

Kindly view the link below for confirmation:

My wife and I wants to use this opportunity to seek for your assistance to help us repatriate this fund to your country for investment purposes
because the fund is not safe here and we can no longer hold on to this fund since Officer Faulkner is no more and we are willing to compensate
you with 35% of the total sum for your help.

We will be very grateful if our proposal is considered and given the urgent attention it deserves. This is our private e-mails:

Sincerely,
Dr. Donald Adams.
