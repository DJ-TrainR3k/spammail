Dear: Customer,

Information reaching us from our corporate headquarters here in Porto - Novo, the capital state of Benin Republic, states that you only have 48hours to
effect your payment for the updating of your mtcn# 493-088-41 to enable you cash up your first $8000 from your total fund of ( Nine hundred and seventy
thousand united state dollars ) since you are finding it difficult to make this payment we have decided that you are to go ahead and pay whatever you have
out of the required fee $450 since you are not able to come up with the total charge. But mind you, no amount below $50 will be accepted so we expect you
to pay whatever amount from $50 and above. You are to pay what ever you have and we will activate your mtcn# number upon receipt of this payment.

Be informed that you will have to pay the balance fee upon cashing up your first $8000 also i am using this medium to inform you that failure to pay
the balance charge will leave us with no option but to deactivate your transfers of which you will and can never cash up the daily payments, i want you to
send the updating and activation fee with the information bellow.
