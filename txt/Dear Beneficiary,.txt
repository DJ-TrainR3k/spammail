Having reviewed all the obstacles and problems surrounding the transfer of your ($10.7 Million) TEN Million Seven Hundred Thousand United States Dollars and your inability to meet up with some charges levied against you due to the past transfer options,we the Board of Directors, Bank Of Africa(BOA) has ordered our Foreign Payment Remittance Unit to issue you a VISA CARD where your payment will be uploaded.

Today, we got the notice that your Payment has been uploaded into this VISA CARD and also have registered it with DHL Express Courier Service. For your information, The delivery charges have been paid and they are supposed to have shipped your packaged (ATM CARD) but they insisted that you must re-confirm to them your current delivery address to ensure accurate Delivery.

MOST IMPORTANTLY: Due to the content of the package, DHL Express mandated that before your package will be shipped, a Stamp Duty MUST be procured according to the New Shipping Creed and the essence of such Document is to ensure a hitch-free delivery. When this is done, DHL Express will issue you with the tracking numbers for your package before the shipping commences Therefore reconfirm your current delivery address.
