Attention :
On behalf of the Trustees and Executor of the estate of Late 
E.F.” Hutton. I once again try to notify you as my earlier letter was returned
undelivered. I hereby attempt to reach you again by this same email address
on the WILL. I wish to notify you that late E.F.” Hutton made you a
beneficiary in his WILL. He left the sum One Million, One Hundred
Thousand Dollars (USD$1, 100.000.00) to you in the Codicil and last
testament to his WILL. Being a widely traveled man, he must have been in
contact with you in the past or simply you were nominated to him by one of
his numerous friends abroad who wished you good. I hope to hear from you in
no distant time.

I await your prompt response.
Yours in Service,

Barrister Rafael Goyeneche Chamber ESQ
