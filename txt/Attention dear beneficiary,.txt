Attention dear beneficiary,

Iâ€™m Dr, Adams Daniel the new  Pinted Manager of DHL Office at Porto
Novo Benin Republic. I assumed this office on 20th, January, 2017. On
going through    the files of the previous records of this office, I
discovered that there are 9parcels containing ATM cards each one
attached with an email address of    the owner on it. The former
appointee of this office (Mr.Fred Sanchez) failed to
carry out the delivery as it was instructed and programmed. Probably,
one of his reasons for not carrying out the delivery was because of
your Non-    Compliance Of Official Processes and Unbelief Of The
Reality Of Your Genuine
Visa Card.

According to the content recorded in each file, the ATM card was
deposited by Mr Mathew Peterson who died one year back as a manager of
Bank of Africa.    On the statement he wrote on the list, he stated
that each of the aforementioned ATM cards contains the sum of
US$4,800,000.00 and was supposed to    transfer to you through his
bank but due to your unable to finish the process he uploaded
the money to their ATM Visa card and registered with DHL office before he
died.

Meanwhile, I've made the arrangement of posting the 9 parcels through
our DHL fast delivery to the 9 of you to your respective mailing
address Am also    sending the same message of the same content to 9
of you that own the abandoned ATM CARDS each at the same time. If
found in spam folder, it could be due    to your Internet Service
Provider, ISP. So move to your inbox before your
reply.

I went to our head office at Cotonou Benin and reported the issue of
the discovered 9 ATM cards in my office and they verified it and gave
me the veto    order to carry out the delivery immediately you
reconfirm your mailing address to this office in order for us to mail
the ATM CARD directly to you.    Note,below information is officially
needed for the sending of the card.

Full name:____
Full mailing info:____
Your cell phone line:_____
Country:_______
Nearest Airport:_____
A.Copy of your I`D:____

I will send your ATM Card once you update us with the above info and
you shall be given a tracking number, that is, the Track and Trace
number of your    parcel once it is posted to your mailing address,
so as to enable you track your parcel to know exactly when it will
arrive to your mailing address.

Remain blessed as I'll be looking forward to receiving your immediate response
