U.S AMBASSADOR TO NIGERIA
PLOT 1075 DIPLOMATIC  DRIVE
CENTRAL DISTRICT AREA, ABUJA

                               From U.S AMBASSADOR TO NIGERIA

Attn: Beneficiary,


Be informed that I have resolved with the Nigeria Presidency to deliver the sum of (USD$15.8m) being the contract/inheritance fund payment.

I shall be coming to your state for an official meeting  this week with your consignment containing the fund which has been packaged and sealed in your favor but has nothing to do with the customs because immunity covering me as an us Ambassador to Nigeria, I am a us government agent and I have the veto power to go through customs without any verification.I am scheduled to have a brief meeting within the secretary of states by this week.

You should send your cell phone number and your delivery house address where you want me to bring the consignment package. You have really paid so much as i was made to understand and that is why i personally have decided to intervened after the G8 meeting with various country government officials. You are a very lucky person because i shall be bringing it myself and there is nothing anyone can do about it.

My trip will be by mid week and i expect you to comply before then so that the delivery can be completed. If you do not comply, then it will be  your fault for not receiving your consignment package.


1. Your Full Names: ...
2. Cell Phone No:..
3. Address where you want me to bring your package..
