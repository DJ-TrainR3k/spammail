May the peace of God be with you and your family.
 
I know it will be a great surprise reading from me today but consider this a divine intervention as a pastor explained to my understanding. My name is Teresa Stang, a widow from Oklahoma USA and I'm writing you from my sick bed because i have been fighting cancer.
 
I will tell you more about myself and also explain why I need your help. Please write me soon as my health is pretty bad and my doctors says i will be moved to the intensive care unit anytime soon.
 
Have a blessed day and please do pray for me.
 
God bless you.
Mother Teresa Stang.
