I (SONIA DAVIES) won a Jackpot of £61Million UK Pounds fortune in Euro Millions Jackpot Lottery in August 2016. After seeking financial advice from my legal counsel with my pastor who advised to donate 10% of our lottery winnings to people as a tithe and thanksgiving. I have now decided to fulfill the promise I made to donate the sum of £500,000(five Hundred Thousand Great Britain Pounds) each to 10 unknown lucky people as part of my charity project to improve the lives of these lucky individuals from around the world.
Fortunately, if you receive this automated email transmission which was electronically selected as beneficiary of this giveaway then you are one of the 10lucky recipients to receive £500,000(five Hundred Thousand Great Britain Pounds). All you should do is to contact my attorney In-Charge BARRISTER Billy Morgan via E-mail with the following information below for fund release from my paying bank.
