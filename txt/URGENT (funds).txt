From: Col. Wendy M. Barnett

      Hello, this is Wendy Barnett (Ms.) of the U.S. Army Aviation and
Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) base
in Afghanistan.

It will interest you to know that I have named you my beneficiary to
receive ($20Million USD) containing in two trunk boxes that have just
arrived the JFK Airport New York, United States.

My desire and purpose is to have the U.S Military Air & Surface
Transportation Company in New York to deliver the two boxes (funds) to you
or to any overseas address under your supervision as long as Iâ€™m assured
that it will be safe in your care until I return home.

PLEASE reply with your delivery address and contact information; the deal
is 60/40 split (60% for me, and 40% for you); I am not a greedy person and
I hope you will not double cross a single Mother who have devoted her life
in the service of our great nation;

God bless you as you extend your helping hand to the needy!

Respectfully,
    Col. Wendy M. Barnett (Ms.), Deputy Director,
(AMRDEC)
