ATTN:

Your payment files from three (3) different banks, NatWest Bank of London,
Citibank of Kenya, united Bank for Africa and Federal Reserve Bank was compiled
and submitted to my desk this month for review. The total sum owed to you by
the 3 banks mentioned above was sum up to the tune of US$4.5 million (Four
Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).

Now the fund has been totally lodged in one particular Escrow account (non
deductible) here in the Federal Reserve Bank on your name, while waiting for
accreditation to your personal bank account in any part of the world.

Meanwhile, after due scrutiny and verification, I confirmed that you have
fulfilled all the necessary obligations that will enable the release of your
payment to you, but yet your payment was not released to you due to one flimsy
excuses or the other from the Bank officials in charge of your payment, because
they had the intention of diverting your funds to their private accounts in
order to satisfy their interest.

You are however lucky that we the management of the Federal Reserve Bank
detected their plans and therefore call for the submission of your payment file
to us so we can personally handle the payment assignment to ensure that you
receive your funds accordingly.

the Federal Reserve Bank , thus, your funds has been made ready for transfer in
our sophisticated macro transfer system, what we need from you now is to
provide to us the bank account of your choice which you want us to transfer
your funds so we can expedite action for the accreditation of your funds into
