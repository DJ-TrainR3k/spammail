Contact Western Union Payment Office

Good Day, I have deposited your check to the WESTERN UNION OFFICE BENIN
REPUBLIC. All you have to do is to contact them at:(www.westernuunion207@gmail.com
 they will give you direction on how you will be receiving your Fund daily. My
agreement with them is $20,000 daily until the whole US$980,000.00 is transfer
complete.

You are not expected to pay for the Transfer fee or any certificate fee because
all the fee is already deducted from the total funds. The only fee you will
send to western union is their official activation fee which i did not know the
amount so when you contact the western union office, try to ask them how much
is their activation fee.

Email them with your full address, the contact person is Dr.Eddy Benson, this
is their direct phone number;+229-98652558

Thank you.
DR.JOHN OBI,
